Deterministic function: for any given input value the function return one and only one output value

Random functions: for any given input value, there might be multiple possible output values

Total function: all the values in the input universe are valid input values and result in an output value

Partial function: only a subset of the input universe is a valid input and result in an output value

Pure functions: no side effects, is deterministic and total

Immutability: variables are not assigned new values, new variables are created

Referential transparency: you can replace a function with its definition

In FP we only use Unary function: only receive one input

Currying: a method to make functions that receives multiple parameters unary

Cardinality of a type: is the number of elements the type has (possible values)
